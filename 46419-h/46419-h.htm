<h2><a name="EDITORS_INTRODUCTION" id="EDITORS_INTRODUCTION">EDITOR'S INTRODUCTION</a></h2>
<p class="stdp">
   Increasingly the church is coming again to use religious pageantry and
   plays for instruction and worship. In the earlier history of religion
   the dramatic expression of religious aspiration and feeling was almost
   universal. The dramatic impulse is deeply grounded in human nature,
   and may be made to appeal to the highest attributes of reverence and
   devotion.
</p>
<p class="stdp">
   Children should usually themselves be the actors and not mere
   spectators. In acting Bible stories they learn how intimately
   the past is linked to the present, and how the struggles of
   to-day after truth, courage, love, are like the struggles of
   the patriarchs and prophets. The stories become more vivid,
   their charm grows, as we study them in action&mdash;our own
   action. And when we have finished the production of a Bible
   play a portion of the most beautiful of all literature is ours
   forever.
</p>
<p class="stdp">
   In a portion of the plays they act out, the children should, under
   wise leadership, devise and prepare their own parts and lines. Along
   with these spontaneously planned representations, however, should come
   a fair proportion of carefully prepared simple artistic plays adapted
   to the age and understanding of the child and calculated to teach the
   lesson desired. Besides teaching their own particular lessons, such
   plays will serve as a model and standard for the children in preparing
   their own presentations.
</p>
<p class="stdp">
   It is the purpose of the present volume to offer a collection of
   shorter Bible plays of high standard, great beauty, simplicity, and
   careful adaptation.
   <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
   All of these plays have been used many times over with groups of
   children in church schools, and their value thoroughly proved. The
   editors offer the book to the church public believing it will be a
   helpful factor in the field of religious education.
</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

<h3>COSTUMES</h3>
<p class="stdp">The costumes used in these Bible plays have been
   largely copied from Tissot's illustrations of the Bible. </p>
<p class="stdp"> A straight piece of bleached or unbleached muslin,
   seamed at the sides up to arm-hole, with a slit for the neck, has been
   found the simplest foundation costume. </p>
<p class="stdp">Variations on this are:</p>
<p class="stdp">A girdle.</p>
<p class="stdp">Sleeves.</p>
<p class="stdp">Fringes.</p>
<p class="stdp"> A cloak of contrasting color, of the same pattern as
   the slip, but open in front.</p>
<p class="stdp"> Several yards of material of contrasting color, thrown
   over the head or shoulders, or draped. </p>
<p class="stdp">Strips of cloth, four to six inches wide, sewed the
   length of the costume. Black strips against white make an effective
   costume.</p>
<p class="stdp">For the head use a square of white cloth bound round with a thick,
   dark cord.</p>
<p class="stdp">For women the cloth may be lighter. They may wear two girdles instead
   of one, with the material puffed out between the girdles. Their veils
   also should be of lighter material; over these a heavy mantle may hang,
   if desired.</p>
<p class="stdp">Barefoot sandals or Japanese sandals will do for the feet, if antique
   sandals cannot be made. In many cases it is preferable that the actors
   go barefoot.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>
<p class="stdp">For bracelets, crowns, scepters, fans, buy sheet copper or brass, tin
   shears, and cut as desired. These will last forever.</p>
<p class="stdp">For soldier costumes, make brilliant, short tunics. Belt these in
   with a twelve-inch strip of brown buckram, which, in turn, is tied on
   with a bright cord. Use cone-shaped caps.</p>
<p class="stdp">Egyptian costumes may always be indicated by a belt with a broad
   flap in the center, reaching from waist to hem. For headdresses, use
   striped cloth; draw the two front ends under the cloth and pin at the
   back of the head.</p>
<p class="stdp">For Babylonian costumes, take several yards of material;
   sew fringe to the ends and one side; pin one end of the goods at the
   back of model; wind goods about waist of model so as to form a skirt,
   and pin to end of goods; carry the rest of the goods around, under
   right arm, over left shoulder, about neck, over right arm; tuck in and
   hold in place by a three-inch belt. For head-gear use tall caps rather
   resembling a sugar loaf. Use heavy white canvas; this may be painted or
   fringed.</p>
<p class="stdp">Try to use strong, bright colors, with white and black and brown.
   Avoid navy blue, turkey red, baby blue or pink. Try to use the same

</ul>
<p class="stdp">The Ark may be built on a framework of wood, covered
   with cloth to represent a child's toy. Bright colors are preferable,
   such as gray and scarlet. Or the Ark may be cut out of wall board. A
   door on hinges must be cut in the side, also a window. A gangplank may
   lead up to door. If the play is given indoors, a blue back-drop may be
   used against which colored lights may be thrown, to indicate storm. If
   given out of doors, a blue, smiling sky is always desirable.</p>
<p class="stdp">Thin tarlatan may be cut in the shape, and painted to represent the
   rainbow, and stretched on a curved bit of wire. </p>

      thou wert born I longed for thee, and since thou wast a
      little lad I have loved thee with a greater love than I have
      given my God. Now I am punished. For the Lord hath commanded
      me, saying: "Take thou thine son, thine only son whom thou
      lovest, even Isaac, and offer him up for a burnt-offering upon
      the mountains." O my son, I shall do even as the Lord hath
      commanded me, for all his ways are perfect. Fare thee well.

   she speaks, and then hold it up so as to conceal herself.</p>

<h3>THE CALL OF SAMUEL</h3>
<div class="dialogue">
   <p>(<i>Enter the</i> <span class="smcap">Prologue</span>.)</p>
   <p><span class="smcap">Prologue</span>: This is the story of
      the call of Samuel. The scene is Shiloh, before the door of
      the tabernacle. Lo, there entereth Eli, priest of Israel.
      (<span class="smcap">Prologue</span> <i>withdraws.</i>)</p>
   <p>(<span class="smcap">Eli</span>, <i>the old priest, enters,
      and stands praying.</i>) <span class="smcap">Eli</span>: O Lord
      God, turn thou my sons, I pray thee, from their evil ways. Lo,
      they come yonder, full of wine and drink, a disgrace to mine
      old age.</p>
   <p>(<span class="smcap">Hophni</span> <i>and</i> <span
      class="smcap">Phinehas</span> <i>come swaggering in, arm in arm.
      One has a jug of wine; he drinks and hands it to the other.</i>
      <span class="smcap">Eli</span> <i>raises a trembling hand toward
      them.</i>)</p>
   <p><span class="smcap">Hophni</span>: Hi there, old man, art
      going to chide again?</p>
   <p><span class="smcap">Phinehas</span> (<i>mockingly</i>): Do not
      show anger, for anger doth not become a man of God.</p>
   <p><span class="smcap">Eli</span>: My sons, why will ye tempt
      the Lord your God? Turn from your evil ways and pray. (<i>Lays a
      hand on</i> <span class="smcap">Hophni</span>.)</p>
   <p><span class="smcap">Hophni</span> (<i>jerking away</i>): I pray
      not, I! Thou hast ever said the Lord was slow to anger.</p>
   <p><span class="smcap">Eli</span>: Yea, but the cup of your
      iniquity is full; and I&mdash;I suffer in your fall. </p>

   <p><span class="smcap">Phinehas</span> (<i>laughs mockingly</i>):
      Ah, so? The iniquity of the children shall be visited upon the
      fathers? Eh? Well, who is responsible if not the father? Come,
      Hophni, come where it is merry.</p>
   <p><span class="smcap">Hophni</span> (<i>eagerly</i>): Yea! (<i>They
      go out singing and taking turns at jug.</i>)</p>
   <p><span class="smcap">Eli</span> (<i>raising his arms
      despairingly to heaven</i>): O God! God! (<i>Passes out.</i>)</p>
   <p>(<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Hannah</span>, <i>followed by
      her husband</i>, <span class="smcap">Elkanah</span>. <i>She is
      weeping.</i>)</p>
   <p><span class="smcap">Elkanah</span> (<i>imploringly</i>): Hannah,
      why weepest thou? And why is thy heart so grieved? If it be
      because thou hast no son, grieve not. Am I not better to thee
      than ten sons?</p>
   <p><span class="smcap">Hannah</span>: Ai, my husband, the
      women mock me that I have no child. (<i>She kneels and prays
      silently.</i>)</p>
   <p>(<span class="smcap">Eli</span> <i>enters and observes her in
      wonder, for silent prayer was unusual.</i>)</p>
   <p><span class="smcap">Eli</span>: Woman, what ails thee?</p>
   <p><span class="smcap">Hannah</span> (<i>rising</i>): Ah, sir, I
      am a woman of sorrowful spirit; I pour out my soul before the
      Lord.</p>
   <p><span class="smcap">Eli</span>: Give me to know thy
      sorrow.</p>
   <p><span class="smcap">Hannah</span>: I prayed unto the Lord
      that he would look upon the affliction of his handmaid, and
      give unto me a man-child. If he do so, then will I give the
      child unto the Lord all the days of his life.</p>
   <p><span class="smcap">Eli</span>: A man-child? Nay, ask more.
      Ask that he grow in the grace and love of God, else will the
      gift be one of sorrow. </p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>
   <p><span class="smcap">Hannah</span>: Ah, sir, that shall be
      <em>my</em> task&mdash;to lead him in the love of God.</p>
   <p><span class="smcap">Eli</span>: Ai, 'tis there that <em>I</em>
      have failed. (<i>He raises his hands and blesses her.</i>) Go thou
      in peace, and the Lord grant thy petition.</p>
   <p><span class="smcap">Hannah</span> (<i>bowing</i>): May
      thy servant find grace in thy sight. (<i>She and</i> <span
      class="smcap">Elkanah</span> <i>go.</i>)</p>
   <p><span class="smcap">Eli</span> (<i>prays</i>): O Lord God, O let
      this, thy servant, find grace in thy sight. Forgive thou the
      iniquity of my sons. For who shall follow after me, O Lord?
      Who shall be judge of Israel, if not my sons? Hear my prayer,
      O Lord, and give unto me an answer of peace. (<i>He bows his
      head and passes out.</i>)</p>
   <p>(<i>The</i> <span class="smcap">Prologue</span> <i>reenters.</i>)</p>
   <p><span class="smcap">Prologue</span>: Now many years have
      passed. Eli is still the priest and judge of Israel, though
      he is blind; and his sons continue still in evil. Yonder
      come Hannah and her husband to give thanks for the gift
      of the child Samuel, and to give him to the Lord. (<span
      class="smcap">Prologue</span> <i>goes.</i>)</p>
   <p>(<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Hannah</span> <i>and</i> <span
      class="smcap">Elkanah</span> <i>leading the child</i> <span
      class="smcap">Samuel</span>.)</p>
   <p><span class="smcap">Hannah</span> (<i>caressing child</i>): See
      thou, this is the very spot on which I prayed the prayer which
      brought me thee.</p>
   <p><span class="smcap">Samuel</span> (<i>roguishly</i>): God heard
      thy prayer, and sent thee a little son to boast of. (<i>He
      smiles up at her.</i>)</p>
   <p><span class="smcap">Elkanah</span> (<i>rumpling</i> <span
      class="smcap">Samuel's</span> <i>hair</i>): Nay, an imp of
      mischief!</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>
   <p>(<span class="smcap">Eli</span> <i>enters, groping blindly.</i>
      <span class="smcap">Samuel</span> <i>regards him in ame.</i>)</p>
   <p><span class="smcap">Samuel</span>: There cometh the priest
      in raiment. (<i>He shrinks away.</i>) Ai! Why walketh he in such
      fashion?</p>
   <p><span class="smcap">Hannah</span>: He is become blind.
      (<i>She advances to him.</i>) Sir&mdash;O Eli&mdash;</p>
   <p><span class="smcap">Eli</span>: Woman, thy voice is known
      to me&mdash;and yet&mdash;who art thou?</p>
   <p><span class="smcap">Hannah</span>: O sir, I am that
      woman who stood here praying, these many years ago. For
      a child I prayed, and the Lord hath granted my petition.
      (<i>She leads</i> <span class="smcap">Samuel</span> <i>to</i> <span
      class="smcap">Eli</span>, <i>who passes his hands delicately
      over the child's head.</i>) Therefore I also have given the child
      to the Lord. As long as he liveth he is granted to the Lord.
      (<i>She turns to</i> <span class="smcap">Samuel</span>.) Kneel
      thou, my son, before this holy man and beseech him to take
      thee into the service of the Lord.</p>
   <p><span class="smcap">Samuel</span> (<i>pulls</i> <span
      class="smcap">Hannah</span> <i>away and puts his lips to her
      ears</i>): Hark'ee, dear mother, I would fain go home with thee
      again.</p>
   <p><span class="smcap">Hannah</span>: Nay, little son, night
      approacheth; we must leave thee.</p>
   <p><span class="smcap">Elkanah</span>: Come, say, "Farewell."

   <p>O Eli, priest of God and judge of Israel, the Lord be with
      thee.</p>
   <p>(<span class="smcap">Hannah</span> <i>and</i> <span
      class="smcap">Elkanah</span> <i>go.</i>)</p>
   <p><span class="smcap">Eli</span> (<i>sits on couch and beckons

      (<span class="smcap">Samuel</span> <i>goes to him reluctantly.</i>)
      What do they call thee?</p>
   <p><span class="smcap">Samuel</span> (<i>sniffling</i>): Samuel,
      master.</p>
   <p><span class="smcap">Eli</span>: Samuel? And what hath thy
      mother taught to thee?</p>
   <p><span class="smcap">Samuel</span>: She hath taught me that
      the Lord Jehovah is one God, and there is none beside him,
      that I must love him and speak truth always.</p>
   <p><span class="smcap">Eli</span>: And what else&mdash;if
      there be aught beside?</p>
   <p><span class="smcap">Samuel</span>: She bade me serve and
      follow in thy steps.</p>
   <p><span class="smcap">Eli</span> (<i>musing</i>): Follow in my
      steps? Come, thou shalt serve these blind eyes and quench the
      candles. (<i>Omit this if there are no candles.</i>) (<i>While</i> <span
      class="smcap">Samuel</span> <i>puts out the candles</i>, <span
      class="smcap">Eli</span> <i>muses.</i>) Follow in my steps? Shall
      it then be this lad, and not my sons, who shall rule Israel?
      Come, little lad, thou shalt lie here the night. (<i>He motions
      to couch on which he sits.</i> <span class="smcap">Samuel</span>
      <i>lies down.</i> <span class="smcap">Eli</span> <i>kneels as though
      before altar.</i>) O
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
      God, God, would that my sons were pure as is this child! Yea,
      I have reared my sons in folly; now I reap the punishment
      thereof. Lo, what shall be the end?</p>
   <p>(<i>He falls silent.</i>)</p>
   <p>(<i>There is a pause; then</i> <span class="smcap">Samuel</span>
      <i>half rouses and listens. He runs to</i> <span
      class="smcap">Eli</span>.)</p>
    <p><span class="smcap">Samuel</span>: Here am I, master, for
      thou calledst me.</p>
    <p><span class="smcap">Eli</span>: Nay, my son, I called thee
      not; lie down again.</p>
   <p>(<i>He reclines on other couch.</i>)</p>
   <p><span class="smcap">Samuel</span> (<i>after a
      pause of about twenty seconds, again runs to</i> <span
      class="smcap">Eli</span>): Here am I, master, for thou

   <p><span class="smcap">Eli</span>: Nay, my son, I called thee
      not; lie down again.</p>
   <p><span class="smcap">Samuel</span> (<i>lies down for twenty

      class="smcap">Eli</span>.) Here am I, master, for <em>truly</em> thou
      didst call me.</p>
   <p><span class="smcap">Eli</span>: Not I! (<i>He reflects.</i>) It
      is the Lord, who speaketh to <em>thee</em> and not to <em>me</em>. Alas, I
      have not the open vision. Go, lie down, and it shall be if
      he call thee, thou shalt say, "Speak, Lord, for thy servant
      heareth."</p>
   <p>(<span class="smcap">Samuel</span> <i>lies down; presently he

   <p>(<i>There is a pause while</i> <span class="smcap">Samuel</span>

      eagerly, then calls.</i>)</p>
   <p><span class="smcap">Eli</span>: Samuel, my son! (<span
      class="smcap">Samuel</span> <i>goes to him slowly.</i>) What is
      this thing the Lord hath spoken to thee? I pray thee, hide it
      not.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span></p>
   <p><span class="smcap">Samuel</span> (<i>reluctantly</i>): He
      said&mdash;he said&mdash;the Lord hath said: Behold, I will
      judge the house of Eli forever, because his sons did bring a
      curse upon themselves, and he restrained them not. Master,
      what did he mean?</p>
   <p><span class="smcap">Eli</span> (<i>slowly and mournfully</i>):
      It is the Lord! Let him do what seemeth unto him good. (<i>He
      raises his arms to heaven.</i>)</p>
   <p><span class="smcap">Shouts Outside</span>: News! News for
      the priest!</p>
   <p><span class="smcap">Eli</span>: What meaneth the noise of
      this tumult?</p>
   <p>(<span class="smcap">Three Soldiers</span> <i>run in.</i>)</p>
   <p><span class="smcap">First Soldier</span>: O Eli, servant of
      God, woe unto thee!</p>
   <p><span class="smcap">Second Soldier</span>: O Eli, be
      strong, and hear the news we bring.</p>
   <p><span class="smcap">First Soldier</span>: Israel hath
      joined battle with the Philistines; Israel was smitten before
      the Philistines.</p>
   <p><span class="smcap">Second Soldier</span>: We brought the
      ark of the covenant to save us: It was thy two sons, Hophni
      and Phinehas, who carried the ark.</p>
   <p><span class="smcap">Third Soldier</span>: And there was
      a very great slaughter&mdash;And thy two sons, Hophni and
      Phinehas&mdash;</p>
   <p><span class="smcap">First Soldier</span> and <span
      class="smcap">Second Soldier</span>: The Lord hath slain them!</p>
   <p>(<span class="smcap">Eli</span> <i>trembles and falls
      backward</i>; <i>the</i> <span class="smcap">First</span> <i>and</i> <span
      class="smcap">Second Soldiers</span> <i>support him.</i>)</p>
   <p><span class="smcap">Third Soldier</span>: Lo, ye have slain
      him with your evil tidings.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>
   <p><span class="smcap">Samuel</span> (<i>runs to</i> <span
      class="smcap">Eli</span> <i>lovingly, and kneels before
      him, embracing him</i>): O my dear master! (<i>A pause, then
      he rises and turns to the soldiers.</i>) Bear him hence
      between you. (<span class="smcap">First</span> <i>and</i> <span
      class="smcap">Second Soldiers</span> <i>lead him out.</i>) (<i>To</i>
      <span class="smcap">Third Soldier</span>.) Grieve not; ye have
      not slain him, but he is smitten of the Lord. For the Lord, he
      came unto me in a vision of the night, saying, I will smite
      the house of Eli forever, because his sons did bring a curse
      upon themselves and he restrained them not.</p>
   <p>(<span class="smcap">First</span> <i>and</i> <span
      class="smcap">Second Soldiers</span> <i>return.</i>)</p>
   <p><span class="smcap">First Soldier</span>: Alas, alas, who
      now shall judge our people?</p>
   <p><span class="smcap">Third Soldier</span> (<i>seizes</i> <span

   <p>(<i>The</i> <span class="smcap">Epilogue</span> <i>advances.</i>)</p>
   <p><span class="smcap">Epilogue</span>: Hear ye the words
      of the preacher, how he said: Even a child is known by
      his doings, whether his work be pure and whether it be
      right. Bring up a child in the way he should go, and
      when he is old he will not depart from it. (<i>The</i> <span

<h3>THE PROPERTIES</h3>
<ul>
   <li>A horn of oil for the Prophet Samuel.</li>
   <li>A sword and horn for Eliab.</li>
   <li>A platter of food for Daughter of Jesse.</li>
   <li>A harp, a loaf of bread, a bottle of wine, a slingshot for David.</li>
   <li>Helmet, spear and shield for Armor-bearer.</li>
   <li>Pebbles for attendant to give David.</li>
   <li>Sword and shield for Challenger.</li>
   <li>Horn and spear for First Messenger.</li>
   <li>Horn and spear for Second Messenger.</li>
   <li>A crown of flowers for Michal.</li>
</ul>
<p class="stdp">For the head of Goliath take a fierce-looking mask;
   attach it to helmet. Sew long swaggering locks of hair on either side,
   and a sweep of red cloth at back. So, when David removes mask from
   Goliath's face, in cutting off his head, the red cloth will give the
   whole a solid appearance.</p>
<p>If possible, have a harp for the music.</p>

   extend walls, three or four feet high, to the front corners of the
   room. These walls may be black or white or yellow or terracotta cloth,
   stretched. Against the walls paste or pin or paint some bold design,
   such as diamonds, in a contrasting color, white against black; deep
   sea-blue against terracotta. Or use the conventional lotus design. For
   the background use a deep sea-blue curtain and throw a blue light upon
   it.</p>

<h3>THE PROPERTIES</h3>
<ul>
   <li>Several gold pieces.</li>
   <li>Palms for children to carry in dance.</li>

<h3>THE JUDGMENT OF SOLOMON</h3>
<div class="dialogue">
   <p>(<i>The</i> <span class="smcap">Wicked Judge</span> <i>is
      seated on the High Place, judging the two women. The</i>
      <span class="smcap">First Woman</span>, <i>at his right,
      holds the</i> <span class="smcap">Baby</span>. <i>The</i> <span
      class="smcap">Second Woman</span> <i>kneels at his left, with
      imploring gestures.</i>)</p>
   <p><span class="smcap">Wicked Judge</span> (<i>with a sweep of
      his hand</i>): No more! No more, I say! I will hear no more.
      Am I not judge in the king, his place? (<i>Points at</i> <span
      class="smcap">First Woman</span> <i>sternly.</i>) <em>You</em> say yonder
      woman's child died in the night-time, and she wants yours.
      (<i>Points at</i> <span class="smcap">Second Woman</span>.) <em>You</em>
      say&mdash;stop sniveling&mdash;(<span class="smcap">Second
      Woman</span> <i>shrinks away from him.</i>) You say 'twas <em>her</em>
      child died and that she hath stolen <em>your</em> child. <em>I</em> say, if
      you had minded your brats properly, there would not be this
      to-do. (<i>A pause.</i>) What were you doing when one of you stole
      the other's child? Gadding about the streets? Eh?</p>
   <p><span class="smcap">Second Woman</span>: O sir, sir, she stole him while I slept.</p>
   <p><span class="smcap">First Woman</span>: Most gracious Judge, I did not steal.</p>
   <p><span class="smcap">Second Woman</span> (<i>turning on her</i>): But thou did'st!</p>
   <p><span class="smcap">Wicked Judge</span>: O you women! Lo, all the troubles of this
      kingdom flow from this, that women do not properly observe the
      affairs of their households. As King Solomon remarks, with rather
      more wisdom than he usually manifests, "Who can find a virtuous
      woman?"</p>
   <p><span class="smcap">Both Women</span> (<i>together</i>): Sir!
      Most gracious Judge! Only hear me&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span></p>
   <p><span class="smcap">Wicked Judge</span> (<i>crashing his fist
      down</i>): Silence! <em>Silence!!</em> (<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Second
      Woman</span>.) Where are your witnesses?</p>
   <p>(<span class="smcap">Second Woman</span> <i>makes an
      imploring and hopeless gesture.</i>)</p>
   <p><span class="smcap">Wicked Judge</span> (<i>fiercely</i>): What?
      No witnesses? Be off! Be off, I say. (<i>He waves both women
      away; then his voice changes.</i>) Stay, wait&mdash;I had forgot.
      I must&mdash;er&mdash;consider the welfare of the infant.
      (<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Second Woman</span>.) It may be
      <em>thou</em> wouldest be the better guardian. Hast thou the means to
      feed and clothe the child, and&mdash;er&mdash;pay all needful
      fees?</p>
   <p><span class="smcap">Second Woman</span>: I am poor, but,
      sir, I am the mother.</p>
   <p><span class="smcap">Wicked Judge</span>: Pshaw! Pshaw!
      (<i>Turns to</i> <span class="smcap">First Woman</span>.) And
      thou?</p>
   <p><span class="smcap">First Woman</span> (<i>producing gold
      pieces</i>): I have these bits of gold. (<i>Her voice takes a
      mocking inflection.</i>) Most gracious Judge, it may be thou, of
      thy great kindliness, wilt guard the gold for me, for I, alas,
      am but a weakling woman, and my child needs all my care.</p>
   <p><span class="smcap">Wicked Judge</span> (<i>pocketing gold</i>):
      Ah, yea, yea, thou art indeed the rightful mother. (<i>Raises
      his eyes to heaven.</i>) More is a child to be desired than
      gold, yea, than much fine gold. I will indeed look after thy
      gold for thee. Now get ye gone. (<i>Turns crossly to</i> <span
      class="smcap">Second Woman</span>.) And count thyself lucky
      that I do not call the guard, and have thee cast into prison
      for bearing lying witness.</p>
   <p>(<span class="smcap">A Boy</span> <i>rushes in, shouting as
      he runs.</i>)</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span></p>
   <p><span class="smcap">Boy</span>: Oh&eacute;! Oh&eacute;!
      King Solomon, he entereth now the city. He cometh here to
      offer sacrifice; the children dance before him. Oh&eacute;!
      Oh&eacute;! (<i>He runs out.</i>)</p>
   <p><span class="smcap">Wicked Judge</span> (<i>gathers up his
      rolls of parchment, shrugging</i>): I will not bow before him, I!

      Woman</span> <i>regards her.</i>)</p>
   <p><span class="smcap">First Woman</span> (<i>laughing</i>): Pray,
      aye, pray! The child will call <em>me</em> "Mother." He will throw
      his little arms about my neck and hail me. For three pieces of
      ruddy gold have I bought him, and thy prayers shall never win
      him from me.</p>
   <p><span class="smcap">Second Woman</span> (<i>fiercely</i>): As
      there is a God in Israel, to whom men pray, I yet shall have
      my child.</p>
   <p><span class="smcap">First Woman</span>: A God in Israel?
      (<i>Shrugs.</i>) As there is god-head in gold, which men worship,
      lo, I shall keep thy child. (<i>She makes a sweeping bow and
      passes out.</i>)</p>
   <p><span class="smcap">Second Woman</span>: O God, God, give
      me my child, my son. Thou knowest the child is mine, thou
      knowest, <em>thou</em> knowest. Thou sawest when in the dark of the
      night-time she crept into my chamber and stole him from me.
      She cradleth him, and I am desolate.</p>
   <p><span class="smcap">Shouts Without</span>: King Solomon!

      David, great mercy according as he walked before thee in
      uprightness of heart; and thou hast kept for him this great
      kindness, that thou hast given him a son to sit on his throne,
      as it is this day. And now, O Lord my God, thou hast made thy
      servant king instead of David my father; and I am but a little
      child. I know not how to go out nor come in. Give therefore
      thy servant an understanding heart to judge thy people, that
      I may discern between good and bad. For who is able to judge
      this thy so great a people?</p>
   <p>(<i>There is a pause during which the</i> <span

   <p><span class="smcap">Second Woman</span>: O king, because
      thou hast asked this thing, and hast not asked for thyself
      long life; neither hast thou asked riches for thyself,
      nor hast asked the life of thine enemies, but hast asked
      understanding to discern judgment, behold, God will give unto
      thee a wise and understanding heart; so that there was none
      like thee before thee; neither after thee shall any arise like
      unto thee.</p>
   <p><span class="smcap">Solomon</span>: Who art thou? for it
      was thus I heard the words of God speaking to my heart! Who
      art thou?</p>
   <p><span class="smcap">Second Woman</span> (<i>prostrating
      herself</i>): The least of thy servants! A grain of dust by the

   <p><span class="smcap">Solomon</span>: Why art thou come here
      to the Hall of Judgment?</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span></p>
   <p><span class="smcap">Second Woman</span>: I came hither for justice;
      but thy judge in Gibeon is as the chaff which the wind beareth
      away&mdash;</p>
   <p><span class="smcap">Solomon</span> (<i>sternly</i>): Beware how thou
      speak evil of them in authority. (<i>Then he smiles.</i>) I gather that the
      case went against thee. What hast thou lost? Fear not; I will requite
      thee. (<i>He offers her gold.</i>)</p>
   <p><span class="smcap">Second Woman</span>: O lord king, my loss was
      not of gold.</p>
   <p><span class="smcap">Solomon</span>: What then? Of land? Lo, I will
      give to thee a bit of land, hard by a spring of water&mdash;</p>
   <p><span class="smcap">Second Woman</span>: O lord king, I have lost no
      rood of land.</p>
   <p><span class="smcap">Solomon</span>: Speak then thy sorrow.</p>
   <p><span class="smcap">Second Woman</span>: O lord king, God gave unto
      thy father David a little son to sit upon his throne. Speak, was thy
      father glad?</p>
   <p><span class="smcap">Solomon</span>: Yea, verily, he rejoiced with
      great rejoicing.</p>
   <p><span class="smcap">Second Woman</span>: And thy mother, Bathsheba,
      was her heart likewise merry?</p>
   <p><span class="smcap">Solomon</span>: My father rejoiced, but his
      rejoicing was naught in the measure with my mother's joy.</p>
   <p><span class="smcap">Second Woman</span>: She would have grieved
      had'st thou been stolen from her?</p>
   <p><span class="smcap">Solomon</span>: What mother would not? But,
      woman, to thy tale&mdash;</p>
   <p><span class="smcap">Second Woman</span>: My tale is told. O son of
      Bathsheba,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
      God hath given to thee an understanding heart. Let it
      read my sorrow; give me back my child.</p>
   <p><span class="smcap">Solomon</span> (<i>bewildered</i>): Woman, I have not
      thy child.</p>
   <p><span class="smcap">Second Woman</span>: Nay, but thy judge in
      Gibeon, for gold he hath rendered false judgment; for gold, he hath
      given my child to another woman.</p>
   <p><span class="smcap">Solomon</span>: Thou canst prove
      this? (<i>She makes a despairing gesture of denial.</i>)
      (<span class="smcap">Solomon</span> <i>claps; the</i> <span

      born.</p>

      filled thy ears with lying tales. Lord king, the woman is mad&mdash;</p>

      mad.</p>
   <p><span class="smcap">Wicked Judge</span> (<i>blandly</i>): Mad,
      I say, mad! Deeming her mad, I have excused what otherwise I

   <p><span class="smcap">Second Woman</span>: I am not mad.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span></p>

      in nowise slay it; for she is the mother thereof, because she

      he entereth now the city! Way for King Solomon, the son of
      David!</p>
   <p><span class="smcap">Soldiers</span>: Way for King Solomon,
      the son of David! Way! Way! (<i>They take positions, one on the
      right hand and one on the left.</i>)</p>

   <p><span class="smcap">Second Soldier</span>: Aye, and to
      render judgment.</p>
   <p><span class="smcap">First Soldier</span>: Is it true, think
      you, that he is wiser than all men that have gone before
      him?</p>
   <p><span class="smcap">Second Soldier</span> (<i>shrugs</i>): So
      men say. As for me, I shall judge for myself.</p>
   <p><span class="smcap">First Soldier</span> (<i>poses
      mockingly</i>): O King Solomon, King Solomon, little thou
      thinkest that the while thou art judging others, a mightier
      shall judge thee!</p>
   <p><span class="smcap">Second Soldier</span> (<i>prodding</i> <span

      son of David!</p>
   <p><span class="smcap">Child</span> (<i>offers silver basket of
      oranges</i>): O king, a word fitly spoken is like apples of gold,
      in baskets of silver, and the king that faithfully judgeth the
      poor, his throne shall be established forever.</p>
   <p><span class="smcap">Solomon</span> (<i>in delight</i>): Ha! Who

   <p><span class="smcap">Child</span> (<i>courtesies demurely</i>):
      Your Majesty!</p>
   <p><span class="smcap">Solomon</span>: Well done! Well spoken!
      I shall strive to be indeed a king whose judgments shall be
      like apples of gold in baskets of silver. (<i>He turns to altar
      and prays.</i>) O Lord God of my fathers, thou hast made thy
      servant king instead of David my father, and I am but a little
      child. I know not how to go out or to come in. Give therefore
      thy servant an understanding heart to judge thy people, that
      I may discern between good and bad. For who is able to judge
      this, thy so great a people?</p>
   <p>(<i>While he prays the</i> <span class="smcap">First

      <span class="smcap">Solomon</span> <i>turns and regards her with
      wonder. She rises.</i>)</p>
   <p><span class="smcap">First Woman</span>: O king, because
      thou hast asked this thing, and hast not asked for thyself
      long life, nor hast asked the life of thine enemies, but hast
      asked understanding to discern judgment, behold God will give
      to thee a wise and understanding heart, so that there

      was none like thee before thee, neither after
      thee shall any arise like unto thee.</p>
   <p><span class="smcap">Solomon</span>: Who art thou? For it

      thou?</p>
   <p><span class="smcap">First Woman</span> (<i>prostrate</i>):
      The least of thy servants&mdash;a grain of dust by the

      come&mdash;here to the Hall of Judgment?</p>
   <p><span class="smcap">First Woman</span>
      (<i>rising</i>): O my lord, I and this woman (<i>Indicates</i>
      <span class="smcap">Woman</span> <i>with</i> <span
      class="smcap">Baby</span>.) dwell in one house, and her son
      died in the night-time, and she arose at midnight and took my
      son from beside me, while thine handmaid slept, and laid her
      dead son beside me&mdash;</p>
   <p><span class="smcap">Second Woman</span> (<i>insolently</i>): She
      lieth, lord king.</p>
   <p><span class="smcap">First Woman</span>: When I arose in
      the morning the child was dead, but when I had considered it,
      behold, it was not my son.</p>
   <p><span class="smcap">Second Woman</span>: Nay, but the
      living is <em>my</em> son, and the dead is <em>thy</em> son.</p>
   <p><span class="smcap">Solomon</span> (<i>regards both silently
      for a few seconds</i>): Women, approach! (<i>Both women stand
      before him.</i>) <em>Thou</em> sayest, "This is my son that liveth,
      and thy son is the dead," and <em>thou</em> sayest, "Nay, but
      thy son is the dead, and mine is the living." (<i>To</i> <span

   <p><span class="smcap">Herald</span> (<i>with curiosity</i>): What
      is in the king's mind? Will he slay yonder woman for bearing
      lying witness?</p>
   <p>(<span class="smcap">First Soldier</span> <i>returns with
      sword.</i>)</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span></p>
   <p><span class="smcap">Solomon</span>: I cannot judge between
      you; let God judge. (<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Soldier</span>.)
      Take thou the sword; divide the living child in two, and give
      half to the one and half unto the other.</p>
   <p>(<i>The</i> <span class="smcap">Second Woman</span>
      <i>crosses hastily to the left as though to flee; the</i>
      <span class="smcap">First Woman</span> <i>darts between
      her and the</i> <span class="smcap">Soldier</span> <i>and
      stands ready, with clinched fists, to defend the</i> <span

      Soldier</span> <i>throws her aside and takes the</i> <span
      class="smcap">Baby</span> <i>from the other woman.</i>)</p>
   <p><span class="smcap">Herald</span> (<i>laughing</i>): O clever
      judge! O mighty son of David!</p>
   <p><span class="smcap">Second Woman</span> (<i>bowing low</i>): I
      bow, lord king, to thy decree. Let the child be neither mine
      nor hers, but divide it.</p>
   <p><span class="smcap">First Woman</span> (<i>with a
      little panting cry, throws herself before</i> <span
      class="smcap">Solomon</span>): O my lord, my lord, give
      <em>her</em> the child, give her the <em>living</em> child, and in nowise
      slay it. Let the child live, even though it be within her
      arms&mdash;lord&mdash;lord&mdash;</p>
   <p><span class="smcap">Herald</span>: O prince of wisdom!
      Through thee indeed the Lord hath spoken. Who would have
      thought to see such mighty judgment, yea in a beardless youth?
      Thy wit hath showed the truth and made this lying woman eat
      her lies.</p>
   <p><span class="smcap">Children</span> (<i>swarming about</i> <span
      class="smcap">Second Woman</span> <i>and bowing to her</i>): Hail,
      mother of the child!</p>
   <p><span class="smcap">First Soldier</span> (<i>raises sword and
      crosses to</i> <span class="smcap">Second Soldier</span>, <i>who
      holds</i> <span class="smcap">Baby</span>): Is it thy will, O
      king, I slay this child, or give it to yon woman? (<i>Indicates</i>
      <span class="smcap">Second Woman</span>.)</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span></p>
   <p><span class="smcap">Solomon</span>: It is my will (<i>he
      raises</i> <span class="smcap">First Woman</span> <i>tenderly</i>)
      thou give unto <em>this</em> woman the living child, and in nowise
      slay it; for she is the mother thereof, because she loveth
      much. For love is strong as death; jealousy is cruel as the
      grave. Many waters cannot quench love; neither can floods
      drown it.</p>
   <p><span class="smcap">First Woman</span> (<i>eagerly receives</i>
      <span class="smcap">Baby</span> <i>and cuddles it</i>): O king,
      he who ruleth over men righteously, who ruleth in the fear
      of God, he shall be as the light of the morning when the
      sun riseth, a morning without clouds, when the tender grass
      springeth out of the earth through clear shining after rain.
      King Solomon, all hail!</p>
   <p><span class="smcap">All</span> (<i>raising palms</i>): King
      Solomon, all hail!</p>
   <p>(<i>All pass out singing the children's song.</i>)</p>

<div class="dialogue">
   <p>(<i>If this play be given out of doors, the thieves must conceal

   <p>(<i>Enter the</i> <span class="smcap">Prologue</span>.)</p>
   <p><span class="smcap">Prologue</span>: And, behold, a certain lawyer stood up, and
      tempted him, saying, Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?</p>
   <p>He said unto him, What is written in the law?</p>
   <p>And he answering said, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy
      heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all
      thy mind; and thy neighbor as thyself.</p>
   <p>And he said unto him, Thou hast answered right: this do, and thou
      shalt live.</p>
   <p>But he, willing to justify himself, said unto Jesus, And who is my
      neighbor?</p>
   <p>And Jesus spake unto them this parable. (<i>The</i> <span class="smcap">Prologue</span>

   <p>(<i>The</i> <span class="smcap">Thieves</span> <i>pop their heads
      out of the shrubbery and advance cautiously.</i>)</p>
   <p><span class="smcap">First Thief</span>: Hark'ee, brothers,
      I have sure word that one of our profession is coming this day
      from Jerusalem to Jericho, bearing rich merchandise.</p>
   <p><span class="smcap">Second Thief</span> (<i>eagerly</i>): To
      join our band?</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span></p>
   <p><span class="smcap">First Thief</span>: Fool, I mean a rich man.</p>
   <p><span class="smcap">Second Thief</span>: Oh&eacute;, a <em>very</em> rich man?</p>
   <p><span class="smcap">First Thief</span>: A <em>very</em> rich man!</p>
   <p><span class="smcap">Third Thief</span>: We will share his
      ill-gotten gains in right neighborly fashion&mdash;if he be
      willing.</p>
   <p><span class="smcap">Second Thief</span>: But if
      not&mdash;?</p>

   <p><span class="smcap">Jew</span>: Come on, my men, come on;
      what do ye fear?</p>
   <p><span class="smcap">First Servant</span> (<i>trembling</i>):
      Master, I like not the look of the lonely road; they say
      thieves lie in wait here to rob rich travelers.</p>

   <p><span class="smcap">First Servant</span> (<i>feelingly</i>): So
      have the thieves.</p>
   <p><span class="smcap">Second Servant</span>: Faint-heart!
      Hath not the master paid us yellow gold to guard his
      merchandise to Jericho?</p>
   <p><span class="smcap">First Servant</span>: Ai! I would I
      were in Jerusalem again. (<i>Suddenly he clutches the other.</i>)
      Yonder! Didst not see something stirring?</p>

   <p><span class="smcap">Second Servant</span>: Bah! (<i>Shakes

      come by this road without finding signs of thievery and
      murder.</p>
   <p><span class="smcap">Second Levite</span>: It gives the
      district a bad name.</p>
   <p><span class="smcap">First Levite</span>: We might carry him
      as far as your home.</p>
   <p><span class="smcap">Second Levite</span>: Nay! If I brought
